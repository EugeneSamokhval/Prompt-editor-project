Thanks for the detailed breakdown. I’ll develop an architectural and statistical solution for a class that calculates the quality rating of a prompt (0–100 scale) based on the model used and weighted attributes such as clarity, detail, context, style references, and more. This will include the algorithm design, evaluation strategy, and suggestions for using Python tools like NLTK, pandas, numpy, and others.

I’ll respond when you message me again with the results.

# Prompt Quality Evaluation System Design

## Introduction  
Designing an automated **Prompt Quality Evaluation** system is crucial for ensuring that prompts yield the best results from different AI models. This system will be implemented as a modular Python class capable of rating prompt quality on a 0–100 scale. The class analyzes a prompt’s text content and adjusts its scoring based on the target model type (e.g. GPT, LLaMA for language; Stable Diffusion, Midjourney for image generation). A well-crafted prompt is known to produce more accurate and useful outputs by being clear, specific, and providing sufficient context ([Writing a Great ChatGPT Prompt](https://www.mxmoritz.com/article/writing-a-great-chatgpt-prompt#:~:text=A%20well,most%20useful%20and%20accurate%20responses)). Therefore, the evaluator focuses on multiple criteria that reflect these qualities. Each criterion contributes a weighted portion of the overall score, aligning with best practices in prompt engineering. In the sections below, we outline the scoring criteria, model-specific weight adjustments, the statistical/NLP methods used for analysis, the class’s architecture, and strategies for evaluating and improving the system over time.

## Prompt Quality Criteria and Weights  
Each prompt is evaluated against several key criteria. The criteria (with proposed weightings toward the final score) are designed to cover all aspects of prompt clarity and richness. The default weights are chosen based on general importance for effective prompts, summing to 100%:

- **Clarity of Main Subject (30%)** – The prompt should clearly state *what* the focus is. This measures whether the prompt has an unambiguous main subject or objective. A high score in clarity means the model can easily identify the primary topic or scene. For example, a prompt that explicitly names the subject (e.g. *“A medieval castle on a hill”*) is clearer than one that is vague or lists unrelated concepts. (This is critical for all models, especially language models like GPT/LLaMA which rely on understanding the user’s intent ([Writing a Great ChatGPT Prompt](https://www.mxmoritz.com/article/writing-a-great-chatgpt-prompt#:~:text=A%20well,most%20useful%20and%20accurate%20responses)).)  
- **Descriptive Adjectives & Details (20%)** – Rich, specific descriptions greatly enhance prompt quality. This criterion assesses the presence of vivid adjectives and concrete details that elaborate on the subject. For instance, *“a **majestic** medieval castle on a **foggy** hill with **ivy-covered** walls”* contains descriptive adjectives (“majestic”, “foggy”, “ivy-covered”) that add detail. Adequate use of adjectives, colors, sizes, textures, or other specifics indicates the prompt paints a clear picture for the model.  
- **Context or Setting (15%)** – Good prompts often provide context such as location, time period, or background setting. This score reflects whether the prompt situates the subject in a broader context or environment. For example, mentioning *“at sunrise in autumn forest”* or *“in the style of a 19th-century study”* gives the model more context to work with. Context is important for both image and text prompts to avoid ambiguity about where or when the subject exists.  
- **Style References / Art Influences (15%)** – Especially for creative tasks, referencing specific styles, genres, or artists can guide the model’s output. This criterion checks if the prompt includes any style cues or influences (e.g. *“in the style of Monet”*, *“cyberpunk theme”*, or *“film noir cinematography”*). Including known art styles or artist names can convey a wealth of visual information to image models with just a few words ([How To Write Effective Prompts for Midjourney (2024) - Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/blog/prompts-for-midjourney#:~:text=Referencing%20specific%20art%20styles%2C%20artists%2C,it%20provides%20more%20visual%20information)). For text prompts, this could mean specifying a tone or format (e.g. “written as a Shakespearean sonnet”).  
- **Image Composition or Layout (10%)** – (Primarily for image generation) This measures whether the prompt describes the desired composition, framing, or arrangement of elements in an image. Terms that indicate camera angles or layout (e.g. *“close-up portrait”, “full body shot”, “foreground and background elements”, “rule of thirds”*) will improve composition clarity. A high score means the user has given hints on how to frame the scene or how multiple subjects are positioned relative to each other.  
- **Lighting and Mood (5%)** – (For image prompts, with some overlap for text tone) Descriptions of lighting conditions and mood help set the atmosphere. Phrases like *“soft ambient light”, “dramatic shadows”, “golden hour glow”* or mood adjectives like *“somber, cheerful, ominous”* contribute to this score. Though a smaller weight, including lighting can significantly enhance an image’s emotional tone ([5 Midjourney Tips for Prompting Cinematic Lighting (+Free PDF) — Curious Refuge](https://curiousrefuge.com/blog/midjourney-tips-for-cinematic-lighting#:~:text=In%20this%20article%2C%20I%E2%80%99ll%20show,to%20create%20Midjourney%20lighting%20prompts)) and mood descriptors can guide language models in tone.  
- **Format and Technical Parameters (5%)** – This looks at whether the prompt includes format specifications or technical cues. For image prompts, that might include aspect ratio (e.g. *“--ar 16:9”* in Midjourney), resolution hints (*“4K, 8k detail”*), medium (*“oil painting”, “35mm photograph”*), or engine/style tags (*“Unreal Engine, Octane render”*). For text prompts, this could include requested answer formats or structural hints (e.g. “in bullet points” or “as JSON”). These technical or format details ensure the output meets certain presentation criteria.  
- **Negative Prompts & Additional Keywords (0–20%)** – This category is applied variably depending on the model and relevance. It accounts for any explicit mention of what *not* to include or other extra keywords that don’t fit in the above categories. In text prompts for GPT/LLaMA, negative instructions are less common (so this may be unused). In image generation, however, providing a negative prompt (undesired elements) can greatly improve output quality. For example, in Stable Diffusion a negative prompt might specify *“no text, no watermarks, no blur”* to avoid those artifacts. If the model and prompt support a well-crafted negative prompt, it can contribute up to 20% of the score, since removing unwanted elements can be as important as adding desired ones ([Stable Diffusion 2.0 and the Importance of Negative Prompts for Good Results | Max Woolf's Blog](https://minimaxir.com/2022/11/stable-diffusion-negative-prompt/#:~:text=rumored%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20part%20of,superior%20than%20traditional%20prompt%20additions)). If negative cues are irrelevant for a given model, this weight is effectively 0%.  

These criteria align with common prompt-writing guidelines. For instance, Midjourney’s own documentation suggests including details about *subject, environment, lighting, mood, and composition* to guide image generation ([Prompt Basics – Midjourney](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32023408776205-Prompt-Basics#:~:text=,eye%20view)). The weighting scheme reflects the relative importance of each aspect, with **Clarity** being paramount (to understand the request) and other stylistic or technical details contributing proportionally. The sum of weighted scores produces a final quality rating between 0 and 100.

## Model-Specific Scoring Adjustments  
Not all criteria are equally important for every model. The class will adjust the weighting or interpretation of criteria based on the target model type, recognizing differences between language models and image models (and even between specific image models):

- **GPT and LLaMA (Language Models):** For large language models, the focus is heavily on clarity, context, and descriptive detail of the request. The criteria like *Clarity of Main Subject* and *Context* receive higher emphasis. For example, a GPT prompt often benefits from explicitly stating the task or question and providing any necessary context or constraints. Being *clear, specific, and providing the right amount of context* is key to guiding LLMs ([Writing a Great ChatGPT Prompt](https://www.mxmoritz.com/article/writing-a-great-chatgpt-prompt#:~:text=A%20well,most%20useful%20and%20accurate%20responses)). Thus, in the scoring logic for GPT/LLaMA, Clarity might be effectively weighted even above 30% (or at least remains at 30% but is scrutinized more strictly). *Descriptive details* and *context* (background information or additional instructions) are also weighted near their defaults. On the other hand, criteria like *Style References* or *Lighting* are typically **less relevant** for text prompts – unless the user specifically asks for a style of writing. Similarly, *Negative prompts* have essentially no role for GPT (you usually tell the model what you want, rather than what to avoid, aside from maybe instructing “don’t do X” which is rare). Therefore, the evaluator might set the *Negative* criterion weight to 0 for these models and ignore image-specific aspects like composition or lighting. The result is that GPT/LLaMA prompt scores mostly come from clarity, sufficient detail, and any contextual framing given.  

- **Midjourney (Image Model):** Midjourney places notable emphasis on art style and lighting to produce visually appealing results. Users are encouraged to use *visual language* and style cues in prompts (such as referencing specific artists or art movements) to convey the aesthetic they want ([How To Write Effective Prompts for Midjourney (2024) - Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/blog/prompts-for-midjourney#:~:text=Referencing%20specific%20art%20styles%2C%20artists%2C,it%20provides%20more%20visual%20information)). Therefore, for Midjourney prompts, the scoring logic boosts the weight or impact of *Style References / Art Influences*. If a prompt includes strong style indicators (e.g. “in the style of Studio Ghibli” or “baroque painting”), it should score higher in the style criterion. Likewise, Midjourney is known to respond strongly to lighting and mood descriptors – *lighting is one of the most important tools for creating mood and depth* in an AI-generated image ([5 Midjourney Tips for Prompting Cinematic Lighting (+Free PDF) — Curious Refuge](https://curiousrefuge.com/blog/midjourney-tips-for-cinematic-lighting#:~:text=In%20this%20article%2C%20I%E2%80%99ll%20show,to%20create%20Midjourney%20lighting%20prompts)). Thus, the evaluator will give the *Lighting and Mood* criterion slightly more weight for Midjourney (perhaps effectively up to 10%). For example, two prompts of the same scene might be distinguished by one saying “dramatic cinematic lighting” and the other not; the one with lighting detail should score higher for Midjourney. Other criteria like *Clarity*, *Context*, *Composition* still matter (and remain at similar weights), but Midjourney can sometimes fill in gaps with its default style if prompts are short. In fact, Midjourney’s docs note that very long, detailed prompts can sometimes confuse the generation ([Prompt Basics – Midjourney](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32023408776205-Prompt-Basics#:~:text=Short%20and%20simple%20prompts%20typically,these%20can%20confuse%20the%20process)). So there is a balance – clarity and concise specificity are rewarded, while overly convoluted prompts might lose points in clarity. Midjourney also allows a “--no” parameter for negative prompting (e.g. `--no plants` to avoid plants in the image), but negative prompts are slightly less critical than in Stable Diffusion. The system might apply a moderate weight (e.g. up to ~10%) for negative keywords in Midjourney – useful if provided, but a prompt won’t be heavily penalized if it lacks a negative prompt.  

- **Stable Diffusion (Image Model):** Stable Diffusion, especially in versions 1.x and 2.x, often requires more explicit prompt engineering to get optimal results. It strongly benefits from well-crafted negative prompts and plenty of detail. In fact, experiments have shown that *negative prompts are key to reliably getting good results* with Stable Diffusion ([Stable Diffusion 2.0 and the Importance of Negative Prompts for Good Results | Max Woolf's Blog](https://minimaxir.com/2022/11/stable-diffusion-negative-prompt/#:~:text=rumored%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20part%20of,superior%20than%20traditional%20prompt%20additions)). Therefore, the evaluator will significantly boost the *Negative Prompts* criterion for Stable Diffusion prompts – up to the full 20% weight if applicable. A prompt for Stable Diffusion that includes a thoughtful negative prompt (e.g. listing unwanted artifacts like “blurry, deformed hands, text”) will score notably higher than one that doesn’t specify negatives, reflecting how much this can improve output quality. Other weights are adjusted to encourage details: Stable Diffusion users often stack many *descriptive adjectives and technical keywords* to coax the model (e.g. *“masterpiece, best quality, intricate details, epic composition”*). The scoring system will recognize and reward such richness in descriptive detail and technical parameters. *Style references* (like artist names or specific art styles) remain important – although SD 2.0 reduced the effect of certain artist names, style cues are still useful for SD 1.5 or custom models. *Composition* and *Lighting/Mood* also help control the output and will be evaluated similarly to the base weights. In summary, for Stable Diffusion: **Clarity** remains vital, **Negative prompt** has high importance, **Style/technical detail** and **descriptive richness** are weighed strongly, and no relevant criterion is left out.  

Under the hood, these adjustments could be implemented by having different weight configurations for each model type. For example, a `weights` dictionary for GPT might assign 0 to image-specific criteria, whereas for Stable Diffusion it allocates the full 20% to negative prompts. The class may either accept a `model_type` parameter (“gpt”, “llama”, “midjourney”, “stablediffusion”) and internally set the weights accordingly, or use subclassing/polymorphism to handle differences. The logic ensures that each model is graded by the criteria that matter most for its domain, aligning with known best practices for that model’s prompts.

## NLP-Based Scoring Methodology  
To quantify each of the above criteria in a prompt, the system will leverage Natural Language Processing techniques. The prompt text will be parsed using libraries like **NLTK** or **spaCy** to extract linguistic features such as part-of-speech tags, dependency parse, and named entities. These provide a statistical basis to score the prompt on each criterion:

- **Tokenization and POS Tagging:** The prompt is first tokenized into words and tagged with parts of speech. This helps identify key components like nouns (potential subjects), adjectives (descriptors), verbs (actions), etc. For instance, counting the number of **adjectives** (JJ tags) is a straightforward way to measure “descriptive adjectives & details.” A higher count (up to a reasonable limit) indicates the prompt uses rich descriptors. We might set a rule such as: if a prompt has, say, 5 or more meaningful adjectives modifying the subject and scene, it scores full points for descriptiveness; fewer adjectives would scale down that portion of the score. POS tagging also helps find if the prompt explicitly contains a **subject noun**. The presence of at least one dominant noun or proper noun can signal clarity of the main subject (e.g. the word “castle” in “A castle on a hill” is a clear main noun). If the prompt lacks a clear noun (for example, just a string of adjectives or a fragment like “beautiful, sunny, high detail”), the **Clarity** score would be low because the model can’t tell what entity those adjectives refer to. Moreover, if multiple unrelated nouns are present (“a castle and a spaceship and a bowl of fruit”), the prompt might be mixing subjects – the evaluation could detect such cases (via dependency or conjunctions) and reduce the clarity score due to potential ambiguity.

- **Dependency Parsing:** Using dependency parse trees, we can understand the grammatical structure of the prompt. This is useful for assessing *Clarity* and *Context*. The parser can identify the main subject and its modifiers. For clarity, we check that there is a single coherent description rather than several disjoint segments. For example, a dependency parse can reveal if the prompt is one connected description (ideal) or two unrelated clauses joined by “and” (which might confuse the model about focus). Dependency relations also help with context: e.g. a prepositional phrase (“in a bustling city”) attached to the main clause tells us the prompt provides a setting. If the parse shows a structure like `[Subject] [...details...] [preposition] [setting]`, then we know context is present. This would boost the *Context or Setting* score. We can also detect *format parameters* or lists at the end of the prompt if they are present, since they might appear as separate segments (for example, parameters often start with `--` in Midjourney; the parser or a simple regex can flag those). 

- **Keyword Extraction and Lexicon Matching:** For criteria that involve specific content (like style, composition, lighting, negatives), the system will use predefined keyword lists or regular expressions. For example:
  - A list of **style keywords** and famous artist names can be compiled. If the prompt contains words like “impressionist, surrealism, Baroque, anime” or “by Van Gogh, by Pixar, cinematic,” we flag those as style references. Even phrases like “in the style of ___” or “inspired by ___” can be identified with regex. The presence of any such term contributes to the *Style References* score. We could weight it such that one strong style reference might already give a good portion of the 15%, and multiple references (if not contradictory) could inch it higher. (The system might also ensure the style references aren’t conflicting; if someone lists many disparate styles, the prompt might be less coherent – but handling that is complex and may be ignored or penalized lightly.)
  - For **image composition**, we maintain a vocabulary of composition-related terms: e.g. *“portrait”, “landscape orientation”, “close-up”, “wide angle”, “panoramic”, “from above (bird’s-eye view)”, “in the background/foreground”*. The prompt is scanned for these terms. Each occurrence or relevant phrase can add to the composition score. If none are found, it doesn’t necessarily mean bad quality (some prompts implicitly assume default composition), but including them shows intentional composition. We might give partial credit if at least one composition term is present, and full credit if multiple or a very clear composition directive is given.
  - **Lighting and Mood** terms can similarly be recognized. We’ll have a list of common lighting words (e.g. *“soft lighting”, “ambient light”, “studio lighting”, “rim light”, “volumetric light”*, *“high contrast”, “shadowy”*) and mood adjectives (like *“happy, eerie, romantic, gloomy”*). The more of these found (appropriately) in the prompt, the higher the *Lighting/Mood* score. Typically even one well-chosen lighting descriptor can fulfill this criterion given its weight is small (5%). The system should differentiate actual lighting terms from unrelated uses of those words, but in a prompt context it’s usually clear (if “dramatic lighting” appears, it’s definitely about lighting).
  - **Format/Technical parameters** can be detected by patterns such as resolution numbers (256x256, 4k, 8k), aspect ratios (`--ar` or formats like `16:9`), or known platform tags like “trending on artstation”, “Unreal Engine”, “Octane render”, “8K UHD”. We might use a regex for `\d+:\d+` to catch aspect ratios, check for “--” prefixed terms (Midjourney parameters), or simply maintain a list of technical terms commonly used in prompts. If the prompt includes these, we award up to 5%. If not, many prompts might still be fine (hence its low weight). For GPT prompts, technical formatting might be things like “Output as JSON:” or “Answer in bullet points:” – the system could look for words like “JSON”, “list of” or formatting cues to credit the user for specifying output format.
  - **Negative prompt** detection will vary by input format. In some UIs, the positive and negative prompts might be clearly separated fields. But if we get a single text, we can attempt to split it. One strategy is to look for a delimiter like a special token or known phrasing. For Stable Diffusion prompt conventions, sometimes the prompt text might contain a separator like `###` or a newline followed by “Negative prompt:” indicating the negative part. Our class could be designed to accept an optional separate negative prompt string, or the single input prompt could be parsed for known patterns (e.g. anything after a `--no ` in Midjourney, or after a keyword “Negative:” could be treated as negative prompt content). Once extracted, we then analyze the negative prompt similarly by checking if it lists common undesirable elements. If it’s non-empty, the mere presence of a negative prompt might give some baseline points, and if it includes meaningful terms (like “blurry, watermark, text, deformed, oversaturated”), we assume it’s a well-crafted negative prompt and grant a higher sub-score. No negative prompt (when the model expects/benefits from one) would yield 0 for this criterion.  

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** This is an optional but useful NLP step. Named entities (like person names, places, organizations) can clue us in to certain aspects:
  - If a **person or artist name** is detected (and it appears in a context like “by [Name]”), that likely counts as a style reference (for image prompts) or indicates a specific context (for example, “Harry Potter” might indicate a style/genre context for a GPT story prompt). We can cross-check recognized PER (person) entities against a list of known artists or characters to avoid false positives.
  - If a **location** (GPE) or time (DATE) entity is detected, that boosts the *Context* score because it explicitly places the prompt in some real or fictional setting. For instance, “Paris in the 1920s” contains a GPE (Paris) and DATE (1920s) – definite context.
  - If **technical terms** show up as entities (like product names or specific tool names), those might be part of style/technical criteria.
  
- **Scoring Calculation:** After extracting all these features, the class will compute a numeric sub-score for each criterion. Typically, each criterion’s score can be on a 0–100 scale internally (or 0–1 as a fraction of its weight). For example, for *Descriptive Details*, we might define: `score_descriptive = min(1.0, num_adjectives / 5)` – meaning we expect 5 adjectives for full points; if only 2 adjectives, that gives 0.4 (40%) of that criterion. Each criterion will have similar logic: either a count-based or boolean-based scoring that is then capped at the maximum. Some criteria are yes/no in nature: e.g. if any style reference is present, one could award full 15% since one solid style cue might suffice, or scale if multiple style cues. Others are more continuous: clarity could be inversely related to the number of distinct subjects or the length of the prompt (if too short or too long, clarity may drop). We will design each scoring function with sensible thresholds drawn from prompt engineering experience and possibly data (e.g., analyzing a sample of good prompts to set these thresholds).

The use of NLP ensures the scoring is **statistical** and not just simple length-based or word-based heuristics. By using POS tagging and parsing, we capture the grammatical role of words (knowing *what* is being described vs. just counting words). This reduces noise, for example distinguishing an adjective used as a name versus as a descriptor. Tools like spaCy provide all these features in one library (tokenization, POS, dependency, NER), making it convenient to implement the analysis pipeline. NLTK could be used for a simpler POS tagging if spaCy is too heavy, but spaCy’s accuracy and integrated features are beneficial for a robust solution. The class might load a spaCy model (like the small English model) at initialization and reuse it for each prompt analysis.

By quantifying each aspect of the prompt, we effectively transform the prompt text into a set of numeric features. The weighted sum of these features (according to the model-specific weights) yields the final quality score (0–100). The design allows transparency as well: we can output the individual criterion scores, which can help users understand why a prompt scored a certain way and how to improve it (for instance, if the *Context* score is 0, the user might consider adding a setting to the prompt).

## Class Design and Modular Architecture  
We propose implementing the above functionality in a modular Python class, e.g. `PromptQualityEvaluator`. The design will emphasize clarity, extensibility, and the use of common data science libraries for text processing and scoring computation (nltk, spaCy, pandas, numpy, etc.):

- **Class Structure:** The class will be initialized with a `model_type` (or possibly take a configuration object of weights). For example: `evaluator = PromptQualityEvaluator(model_type="midjourney")`. In `__init__`, it will define the weights for each criterion according to the chosen model. This could be done via a static mapping, e.g. a dictionary of weight dicts: 
  ```python
  MODEL_WEIGHTS = {
      "gpt":  {"clarity": 0.30, "descriptive": 0.25, "context": 0.20, "style": 0.05, "composition": 0.0, "lighting": 0.0, "technical": 0.05, "negative": 0.0},
      "midjourney": {"clarity": 0.25, "descriptive": 0.20, "context": 0.10, "style": 0.20, "composition": 0.10, "lighting": 0.10, "technical": 0.05, "negative": 0.0},
      "stablediffusion": {"clarity": 0.30, "descriptive": 0.20, "context": 0.10, "style": 0.15, "composition": 0.10, "lighting": 0.05, "technical": 0.05, "negative": 0.20},
      ...
  }
  ``` 
  (These numbers are illustrative; the Midjourney weights here emphasize style and lighting a bit more, while Stable Diffusion includes the full 20% negative, etc., as discussed.) The class stores the active weight dict for its model. We can easily adjust these weight configurations or add new model profiles (like if a new model type emerges, just add an entry).

- **Parsing and Feature Extraction:** The class will have an internal method (or utilize an external function) for analyzing the prompt text. For example, a method `_analyze_prompt(text)` that returns a structured representation (perhaps a dict of features or a spaCy `Doc` object plus some custom extracted info). This method would:
  1. Run the NLP pipeline (spaCy or NLTK) on the text.
  2. Extract counts like number of adjectives, number of nouns, etc.
  3. Identify presence of context (maybe a boolean or count of prepositional phrases).
  4. Check for any style keywords, composition terms, lighting terms – perhaps returning a boolean or count for each category.
  5. Identify if a negative prompt is present (maybe the prompt text is split by a delimiter or this is provided separately in a parameter).
  
  This analysis step encapsulates all the text processing so that the scoring functions can be simpler and mostly operate on the extracted data.

- **Criterion Scoring Methods:** For modularity, we can implement each criterion’s scoring as a separate method (or at least a separate block of code) that takes the analysis results. For example:
  - `score_clarity(analysis)` – checks main subject presence and any ambiguity. It might use `analysis['main_noun']` (if extracted) and `analysis['num_main_subjects']` or similar to decide. Perhaps: if exactly one main subject and it's clearly defined, return 1.0 (100%) for clarity; if multiple subjects or none, return lower values accordingly.
  - `score_descriptive(analysis)` – uses `analysis['adj_count']` or possibly a ratio of adjectives to nouns. Could also consider length: extremely short prompt likely lacks detail (so if word count < say 5, descriptive score is low even if all words are adjectives). Conversely, a very long prompt might have diminishing returns.
  - `score_context(analysis)` – perhaps check `analysis['has_context']` or count of setting descriptors. If none, 0; if one or more, could be full or partial if minimal.
  - Similarly, `score_style`, `score_composition`, `score_lighting`, `score_technical`, `score_negative` each looking at relevant flags or counts.
  
  Having these as separate methods makes it easy to adjust the logic per criterion without touching the others. It also allows overriding in subclasses if needed (e.g., if a future subclass for a specific model needs a special handling of a criterion).

- **Overall Evaluation:** The main public method would be `evaluate(prompt_text)` (and possibly `evaluate(prompt_text, negative_text=None)` if we allow separate negative prompt input). This method will:
  1. Perform the text analysis via `_analyze_prompt`.
  2. Call each `score_*` method to get a normalized score (0.0 to 1.0) for each criterion.
  3. Multiply each by its weight percentage and sum them up to get a final numeric score. For example, `final_score = sum(weight[c] * score_c for c in all_criteria) * 100` (if weights are fractional like 0.30). Or if weights are already in percentages, sum of (score_c * weight_percentage).
  4. Return the final score (and optionally a breakdown). It might be useful for the method to return a dictionary like `{"total_score": 78.5, "breakdown": {"clarity": 25/30, "descriptive": 15/20, ...}}` indicating the points obtained out of each criterion’s max. This can help debug or inform the user which areas to improve.
  
- **Use of Libraries:** 
  - *spaCy:* The class might use spaCy’s English model for convenience. On initialization, `PromptQualityEvaluator` could load the spaCy model (e.g. `en_core_web_sm`) and store the `nlp` object. Then `_analyze_prompt` does `doc = self.nlp(prompt_text)`. From `doc`, we get `doc.ents` (named entities), `doc.sents` (sentences), and token attributes like `token.pos_` and `token.dep_`. This simplifies POS and dependency logic. SpaCy’s dependency parse can directly tell us the root of the sentence and how many conjuncts, etc., which we use for clarity/ambiguity checks. 
  - *NLTK:* If we decide spaCy is too heavy or not desired, NLTK could be used for tokenization and POS tagging (`nltk.pos_tag`). We might then need other tools or manual checks for things like dependency (perhaps not as straightforward as spaCy, but for our needs, maybe counting commas or conjunctions could approximate multiple clause detection). However, spaCy’s comprehensive pipeline is likely worth using for a robust solution.
  - *Pandas & NumPy:* While not strictly required for single instance scoring, these could come into play for analyzing results over a dataset of prompts. For instance, if we have a `pandas.DataFrame` of prompts, we could vectorize the scoring or apply the `evaluate` function to each and gather statistics. Numpy might be used inside the class for any numeric arrays (for example, if converting lists of keyword matches into a numeric feature vector). Additionally, if we decide to fine-tune weights or combine criteria in a linear model fashion, numpy could help solve for optimal weights given a sample dataset. Pandas could be useful in the **evaluation phase** to examine scoring distributions (discussed later) by providing quick summary stats on scores.
  
- **Modularity and Extensibility:** The class is built so that new criteria can be added easily. We might define a list of criteria names and their weights, and iterate through them for scoring. This avoids hardcoding the combination logic. For example, we could have:
  ```python
  self.criteria = [
      ("clarity", self.score_clarity, self.weights["clarity"]),
      ("descriptive", self.score_descriptive, self.weights["descriptive"]),
      # ... and so on
  ]
  ```
  Then the evaluate function can loop over `self.criteria`. This way, if we want to add a new criterion (say “Creativity” or something in the future), we add a method and put it in the list with a weight. This design also means we could allow users of the class to adjust weights if needed (for instance, if an advanced user wants to tweak the importance of something). 

- **Example Workflow:** As a brief example, suppose the prompt is:  
  *“A futuristic cityscape at dusk, **neon lights** illuminating skyscrapers, **cinematic** style, **ultra-wide angle**, --ar 16:9, **no cars**”* (intended for Midjourney).  
  The evaluator for Midjourney would parse this and extract: main subject “cityscape” (clarity good), adjectives like “futuristic” (descriptive detail), context “at dusk” (time setting), style “cinematic” (style reference), composition “ultra-wide angle” (composition), lighting “neon lights illuminating” (lighting/mood element), technical parameter “--ar 16:9” (format aspect ratio), and negative “no cars” (negative prompt to exclude cars). Each of these hits the respective criteria, likely yielding a high total score. The class would output a score perhaps in the high 80s or 90s and indicate each category scored well. In contrast, a poorer prompt like *“beautiful city”* (no context, no style, very generic) might score very low (maybe 20s or 30s) especially for an image model, and the breakdown would show it lacked context, style, etc.  

The modular class approach thus cleanly separates the concerns: text analysis vs. scoring logic vs. weighting. It leverages NLP libraries for the heavy lifting of parsing, and uses simple statistical rules to turn those parse results into a numeric evaluation. The design is flexible to updates – for instance, if a new insight suggests increasing the weight of a criterion or adding new keywords, we can change configuration without rewriting the whole algorithm.

## Evaluation and Improvement Strategies  
Designing the system is only the first step – we also need a plan to **evaluate its performance and continuously improve** it. Since prompt quality can be somewhat subjective, we should ensure our automated scores align with human judgment and lead to better model outputs. Below are strategies for evaluation and refinement:

- **Compare with Human Ratings:** To validate the scoring system, we can create a benchmark dataset of prompts that have been rated by humans (or experts) for quality. For each model type, gather a diverse set of prompts – some well-crafted, some average, some poor – and ask experienced users or annotators to assign a quality score (or rank them). We would then run our `PromptQualityEvaluator` on these prompts and see how the scores correlate with human scores. A high correlation would indicate the criteria and weights are on target. If we find systematic differences (e.g. our system gives a low score to a prompt humans thought was good due to some nuance we missed), that’s a signal to adjust the logic. For example, maybe our algorithm penalized a prompt for being slightly long, but humans found it clear – we might relax the length penalty. Through this process, we calibrate the system. We could use statistical measures like Pearson correlation or Spearman rank correlation between the evaluator’s scores and the average human ratings to quantify agreement. Ideally, any adjustments to weights or thresholds are done to improve this agreement.

- **Scoring Distribution Analysis:** We should examine the distribution of scores our system produces on a large set of prompts (for each model). If possible, collect real user prompts (perhaps from public forums or libraries) to see what scores they get. The distribution should be reasonable – for instance, not all prompts should score extremely high or extremely low. We expect a bell-curve or similar spread, where truly excellent prompts get 90+, average ones around 50–70, and bad ones below 30. If we discover that almost every prompt is scoring, say, above 80, then our criteria might be too lenient or weights too generous; conversely if even decent prompts rarely break 50, the system might be too harsh. Adjusting the weighting or scaling of certain criteria can help. The use of pandas or numpy can aid in computing these distributions and identifying any bias in scoring. For example, if we see the *Style* criterion almost always scores 0 in GPT prompts (because style isn’t used) which drags down the total, we might ensure that criterion is truly zero-weighted for GPT to not unfairly skew the total.

- **Bootstrapping from Datasets:** If direct human ratings are hard to get initially, we might bootstrap using indirect signals or synthetic data:
  - Use existing prompt-and-output datasets. For image models, there are galleries (like on Midjourney or Stable Diffusion communities) where people share prompts and images. Those often have upvotes or likes which could serve as a proxy for prompt quality (albeit conflated with image quality). By analyzing which prompts led to highly-rated images, we can infer what good prompts contain. We could assemble a list of “good” prompts from these and ensure our system gives them high scores. Similarly, very unsuccessful prompts (where outputs failed) might be available in forums for analysis as “bad” prompts to score low.
  - Generate synthetic variations of prompts. We could take a decent prompt and intentionally remove details or add fluff to create a worse version, then check that the evaluator scores the original higher than the degraded one. This is a form of unit testing for the criteria (e.g., remove the context phrase and see if the context score and total go down, as expected).
  - We might even leverage an LLM (like GPT-4) to act as a pseudo-annotator by asking it to rate prompts, to have a baseline to compare against. This isn’t as good as real human ratings, but could be a quick way to refine obvious issues.  

- **Continuous Improvement via Feedback:** Once the system is in use (for example, integrated into a prompt-building tool), we can gather feedback from end users. If the class provides a breakdown of scores, users might report cases where they feel a score is unfair. For instance, a user might say “I got a low score for composition, but I think my prompt did imply composition.” Investigating such cases could reveal new ways people phrase things that our keyword list didn’t catch. We could then update the keyword lexicons or logic to handle those. In essence, treat the evaluator as an evolving product: monitor its “mistakes” and correct them. 

- **Comparison with Output Success:** Another indirect evaluation is to see if higher prompt scores actually correlate with better outputs from the models. This is a longer-term check: for image models, perhaps define some objective or subjective metric of output quality (like image sharpness, or human preference between outputs). If our scoring system is effective, prompts it rates higher should on average yield better results. If not, we might be weighting something wrongly. For language models, one could check if higher-scoring prompts produce more relevant or correct answers from GPT. These correlations can validate that the criteria we chose truly impact the quality of results.

- **Updating Criteria and Weights:** The initial criteria and weights are based on known best practices up to 2025. However, AI models evolve, and prompt techniques change (for example, a new version of Stable Diffusion might reduce the need for negative prompts or a new image model might introduce other parameters). We must be prepared to update the evaluation system accordingly. Thanks to the class’s modular design, updating is straightforward: adjust the weight configuration for the model, or modify a scoring function. We should maintain a changelog of such adjustments. In a more automated approach, if we gather a sufficient dataset of prompts with “ground truth” quality labels, we could even use machine learning to optimize the weights. For instance, perform a regression where the features are our criterion scores and the target is a human-given score – the regression coefficients might suggest better weights than our hand-chosen ones. Those could be fed back into the system (this is essentially turning the heuristic approach into a learned approach given data). Nonetheless, even in a heuristic system, periodic review is important. *Having clear evaluation criteria allows objectively measuring prompt quality and highlights points for improvement ([Creating Evaluation Criteria and Datasets for your LLM App | by Seya | Medium](https://seya01.medium.com/creating-evaluation-criteria-and-datasets-for-your-llm-app-85d28184dd77#:~:text=Having%20evaluation%20criteria%20allows%20for,stable%20output%20for%20various%20inputs))*, which applies not just to users improving prompts but to us improving the evaluator itself. We will treat our criteria as living criteria – open to refinement.

- **User Education and Transparency:** As part of improvement, it’s good to ensure users understand what the score means. Along with the numeric rating, the system can provide a brief feedback per criterion (similar to how a writing assistant might say “Try adding a setting to your prompt for more context.”). This wasn’t a core requirement, but it complements the evaluator. By seeing common shortcomings (e.g. many users get low style scores), we might decide to add more guidance in documentation or adjust how strictly we score that. In doing so, we improve the overall ecosystem of prompt writing.

In summary, we will validate the Prompt Quality Evaluation class by comparing its judgments with human expectations and real-world outcomes, and refine it using both data-driven and rule-based adjustments. This ongoing process ensures that the scoring system remains accurate and fair. By combining a solid initial design with iterative evaluation, the system can evolve to keep up with new models and emerging prompt engineering insights, ultimately guiding users to craft better prompts and achieve optimal results from AI models.

## Conclusion  
The proposed design provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating prompt quality in a consistent, quantifiable manner. We defined clear criteria covering the key elements of effective prompts and tailored the weighting of these criteria to different model types (language vs. image, and specific models like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion). Using NLP techniques like POS tagging, dependency parsing, and keyword detection, the system can parse a prompt and score each aspect, yielding an overall quality score out of 100. The Python class implementation follows a modular design, making it easy to update criteria or extend to new models. By implementing evaluation and feedback loops – including comparisons to human ratings and analysis of score distributions – we can fine-tune the system for accuracy. This tool would be valuable for prompt engineers and AI users: it can serve as a “prompt writing assistant,” providing an objective score and pointing out how to improve the prompt (e.g. add clarity or detail), thereby enhancing the effectiveness of prompts across GPT, LLaMA, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and future models. With a solid architectural foundation and a statistical scoring approach, the Prompt Quality Evaluation system is well-equipped to adapt and remain relevant as AI models and prompt techniques continue to develop.
