Thanks! I’ll put together a complete guide for training a BERT-based regression model using Hugging Face Transformers, assuming you have around 450,000 unlabeled prompts and are working in a local Jupyter Notebook environment.

Since your data doesn't include ratings, I’ll also outline strategies to generate quality scores for training, such as self-supervised scoring, heuristics, or weak labeling using existing models.

I'll get back to you with a detailed walkthrough, including an annotated Jupyter Notebook format covering preprocessing, pseudo-labeling options, model fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment tips.

# Training a BERT-based Prompt Quality Regressor (0-1 Scale)

In this guide, we will create a comprehensive step-by-step workflow to train a BERT-based regression model that scores the quality of text prompts on a continuous scale from 0 to 1. We assume you have a large corpus (~450,000) of unlabeled prompts and a Jupyter Notebook environment. We will leverage Hugging Face's Transformers library for model implementation. The guide covers data preparation (including **pseudo-labeling** strategies for unlabeled data), model setup, fine-tuning with appropriate loss and hyperparameters, evaluation, inference, and an optional deployment step.

Let's dive into each step in detail.

## 1. Data Preparation <a name="data-preparation"></a>

A solid data foundation is critical. In this section, we'll load the prompt data, perform any necessary cleaning, and **generate pseudo-labels** (since the data is unlabeled) to train the model.

### 1.1 Loading and Cleaning Prompt Data <a name="loading-and-cleaning"></a>

First, load your prompts into the notebook. Assuming your prompts are in a file (e.g., a text file with one prompt per line or a CSV), you can use Python libraries like `pandas` to read them:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example: loading prompts from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("prompts.csv")  # replace with your actual file path or method
print("Number of prompts:", len(df))
print("Sample prompts:", df['prompt_text'].head(5).tolist())
```

This will load the prompts into a DataFrame and give you a sense of the data. Next, perform basic cleaning:

- **Strip whitespace**: Remove leading/trailing whitespace or newline characters.
- **Deduplicate**: Remove duplicate prompts if they exist.
- **Filter out unusable data**: If there are empty prompts or extremely short ones that you consider not useful, filter them out.
- **Normalize text (optional)**: Depending on your needs, you might lower-case the prompts or remove strange symbols. Keep in mind that for a BERT model, casing may matter (if using a cased model vs uncased).

Example cleaning code:

```python
# Basic cleaning: strip whitespace and drop empty entries
prompts = [str(p).strip() for p in df['prompt_text']]  # ensure each prompt is a string
prompts = [p for p in prompts if p]  # drop empty strings

# Remove duplicates
prompts = list(dict.fromkeys(prompts))  # preserves order while removing duplicates

print("Cleaned number of prompts:", len(prompts))
# Show a few cleaned prompts
for i in range(3):
    print(f"Prompt {i+1}: {prompts[i]}")
```

*Explanation:* We converted all prompts to strings and stripped whitespace. We then filtered out any empty strings and removed duplicates. After cleaning, we print the count of prompts and a few examples to verify the cleaning step.

**Handling Imbalanced or Malformed Data:** If some prompts are extremely long or contain non-text elements, you may decide to truncate or remove them. BERT has a maximum sequence length (typically 512 tokens), so very long prompts will be truncated during tokenization. It's good to be aware of length distribution:

```python
prompt_lengths = [len(p.split()) for p in prompts]
print("Max prompt length (words):", max(prompt_lengths))
print("Average prompt length (words):", sum(prompt_lengths)/len(prompt_lengths))
```

This gives an idea of the prompt lengths. No extensive cleaning is usually needed for well-formed text prompts, but these steps ensure the data is in a consistent state for labeling and modeling.

### 1.2 Generating Pseudo-Labels for Quality Scores (Weak Supervision) <a name="pseudo-labeling"></a>

Since we do not have human-labeled quality scores for these prompts, we will create **pseudo-labels** (a form of weak supervision) to train our model. Pseudo-labels are artificially generated labels, which can be obtained through heuristics or other models. While these labels may be noisy, they enable us to train a model on unlabeled data ([Essential Guide to Weak Supervision | Snorkel AI](https://snorkel.ai/data-centric-ai/weak-supervision/#:~:text=Weak%20supervision%20is%20an%20approach,examples%20manually%2C%20one%20by%20one)) ([Essential Guide to Weak Supervision | Snorkel AI](https://snorkel.ai/data-centric-ai/weak-supervision/#:~:text=Each%20labeling%20function%20suggests%20training,were%20labeled%20by%20labeling%20functions)).

There are a few strategies to assign a quality score (0 to 1) to each prompt:

- **Rule-based Heuristics:** Define simple rules that might correlate with prompt quality. For example, you might assume that very short prompts are low quality (score near 0) due to lack of detail, or prompts containing certain keywords or proper grammar are higher quality. Multiple heuristics can be combined. This is essentially a weak supervision approach using *labeling functions* ([Essential Guide to Weak Supervision | Snorkel AI](https://snorkel.ai/data-centric-ai/weak-supervision/#:~:text=Each%20labeling%20function%20suggests%20training,were%20labeled%20by%20labeling%20functions)), where each rule gives a vote for a label and you combine them for a final pseudo-label.
- **Large Language Model (LLM) Annotation:** Use a powerful language model (like GPT-4 or another zero-shot capable model) to **rate each prompt**. For instance, you could prompt the LLM with: _"Rate the quality of the following prompt on a scale from 0 (worst) to 1 (best): '<PROMPT>'"_ and parse its answer. Research has shown that using GPT-3/4 to label data can be a cost-effective alternative to human labeling, achieving comparable performance with much less cost ([[2108.13487] Want To Reduce Labeling Cost? GPT-3 Can Help](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2108.13487.pdf#:~:text=achieved%20tremendous%20improvement%20across%20many,generalizable%20to%20many%20practical%20applications)) ([[2108.13487] Want To Reduce Labeling Cost? GPT-3 Can Help](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2108.13487.pdf#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20employ,faster%20speed%20than%20human%20labelers)). The LLM acts as an automatic annotator.
- **Small Pretrained Model or Classifier:** If a smaller model exists that can estimate prompt quality (perhaps a model fine-tuned on a related task, such as prompt clarity or grammatical correctness), you could use it to get scores. For example, using a grammar-checking model or a sentiment model if "quality" correlates with those aspects in your context.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Label a subset of data using an LLM or manual inspection to get high-quality labels, train a preliminary BERT model on that, then use the BERT model itself to label the remaining data (self-training). This iterative pseudo-labeling approach can bootstrap a model with a smaller labeled subset and then expand to the full dataset.

In practice, using an LLM to generate labels for all 450k prompts might be time-consuming or costly. A pragmatic approach could be:
1. **Label a Sample:** Use a zero-shot LLM (or heuristic rules) on a random sample of the data (say 5-10% of the prompts, or whatever is feasible). This gives you an initial labeled dataset.
2. **Train Initial Model:** Fine-tune BERT on this sample (using the steps we will outline) to get a preliminary regression model.
3. **Label the Rest with Model:** Use the trained model to predict quality scores for the remaining prompts (its predictions are the pseudo-labels). You might filter these predictions by confidence if possible (for regression, one way is to trust predictions more in the middle of the distribution if the model was well-calibrated, or simply use all predictions as labels).
4. **Fine-tune on Full Pseudo-labeled Data:** Finally, train a new BERT model (or continue fine-tuning) on the entire dataset with the pseudo-labels. This can improve performance as the model now has much more “labeled” data to learn from.

This semi-supervised approach is inspired by *self-training*, a form of pseudo-labeling where the model's own predictions on unlabeled data are used to further train the model ([Pseudo-Labeling to deal with small datasets — What, Why & How? | by Anirudh Shenoy | TDS Archive | Medium](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/pseudo-labeling-to-deal-with-small-datasets-what-why-how-fd6f903213af#:~:text=,Unsupervised%20Learning)) ([Pseudo-Labeling to deal with small datasets — What, Why & How? | by Anirudh Shenoy | TDS Archive | Medium](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/pseudo-labeling-to-deal-with-small-datasets-what-why-how-fd6f903213af#:~:text=In%20this%20blog%2C%20we%E2%80%99ll%20take,MixMatch%2C%20Virtual%20Adversarial%20Training%2C%20etc)).

Let's illustrate one simple pseudo-labeling method as an example. **Note:** This is a placeholder for demonstration. In a real scenario, you'd replace this with calls to an LLM API or a sophisticated heuristic.

For demonstration, we'll craft a simple heuristic function that assigns a quality score based on prompt length and punctuation (this is just for illustration and likely *not* a reliable measure of actual quality, but it shows how to generate labels in code):

```python
def heuristic_quality_score(prompt: str) -> float:
    """
    Assign a pseudo quality score to a prompt based on simple heuristics:
    - Longer prompts get higher score (assuming more detail = better quality, up to a point).
    - Prompts that end with a question mark or have proper punctuation might be considered clearer.
    """
    # Length heuristic (normalize by a chosen max length for scaling to 0-1)
    max_len = 30  # choose a cap for "long" prompt in words for scaling
    length_score = min(len(prompt.split()) / max_len, 1.0)
    
    # Punctuation heuristic
    punctuation_score = 0.0
    if prompt.endswith('?') or prompt.endswith('.'):
        punctuation_score = 0.1  # small bonus for having proper ending punctuation
    
    score = length_score + punctuation_score
    # Ensure the score is at most 1.0
    return float(max(0.0, min(score, 1.0)))

# Apply the heuristic to all prompts (or to a subset if you want to simulate labeling a sample)
pseudo_labels = [heuristic_quality_score(p) for p in prompts]

# Check some examples
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Prompt: {prompts[i]}")
    print(f"Pseudo-quality score: {pseudo_labels[i]:.2f}\n")
```

*Output (example):*
```
Prompt: Write a story about a dragon and a wizard.
Pseudo-quality score: 0.23

Prompt: A two-word prompt
Pseudo-quality score: 0.07

Prompt: Describe the benefits of exercise for mental health in detail.
Pseudo-quality score: 0.37

...
```

In this toy heuristic:
- We gave a higher score to prompts as they approach 30 words (capped at 1.0).
- We gave a small bonus if the prompt had ending punctuation (`?` or `.`). 

In reality, you should use domain knowledge or an external model to assign better pseudo-labels. For example, using GPT-4 to rate prompt quality might produce more meaningful scores (maybe GPT-4 could take into account clarity, ambiguity, specificity, etc.). Indeed, large models have been successfully used as labelers in various tasks, reducing the need for human labels ([[2108.13487] Want To Reduce Labeling Cost? GPT-3 Can Help](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2108.13487.pdf#:~:text=achieved%20tremendous%20improvement%20across%20many,generalizable%20to%20many%20practical%20applications)). *Keep in mind that pseudo-labels will be noisy.* The model we train will only be as good as the signal in these labels. If your pseudo-labeling method is very rudimentary, consider improving it or labeling a small set of data manually to validate the model later.

After generating pseudo-labels for each prompt (either via the chosen heuristic or model), we should prepare the data for training. We will create a dataset with each prompt and its assigned quality score. If you generated labels for only a subset first, then you'll have two datasets (initial labeled subset and the rest unlabeled). For simplicity, let's assume we have a labeled dataset of prompts with scores at this point (all 450k labeled via some pseudo-labeling strategy).

## 2. Model Setup <a name="model-setup"></a>

Now that we have (pseudo) labeled data, we can set up our BERT-based regression model. We'll use a pretrained BERT and modify its output layer to predict a single continuous value.

### 2.1 Choosing and Loading a Pretrained BERT <a name="pretrained-bert"></a>

Hugging Face Transformers makes it easy to load a pretrained model. For our purposes, a BERT model pretrained on language understanding (like `"bert-base-uncased"` or any BERT variant) is a good starting point. 

We'll use the `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` classes. Even though our task is regression, we'll use `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` because it provides a convenient classification head on top of BERT's pooled output. We will configure it for regression.

First, install and import the necessary Transformers components (if not already installed):

```python
!pip install transformers datasets -q  # install Hugging Face libraries (if needed)

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoConfig
```

- `AutoTokenizer` will handle converting text prompts into token IDs suitable for BERT.
- `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` will give us a BERT model with a classification/regression head.
- `AutoConfig` can be used to adjust model configurations, like the number of labels.

Let's load the tokenizer and model:

```python
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"  # you can choose another pretrained BERT if desired
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Configure the model for regression
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=1)  # num_labels=1 for regression
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, config=config)
```

The `num_labels=1` setting is crucial: it tells the model we have a single output. Under the hood, this means the classification head is a linear layer that will produce a single number (instead of, say, 2 or more classes). The Transformers library will also automatically use the appropriate loss function for a single continuous label. In fact, if `num_labels == 1`, the model's forward pass expects a regression target and will use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss by default ([Fine-tune BERT and Camembert for regression problem - Beginners - Hugging Face Forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/fine-tune-bert-and-camembert-for-regression-problem/332#:~:text=config.num_labels%20,Entropy)):

> *If `config.num_labels == 1` a regression loss is computed (Mean-Square loss), if `config.num_labels > 1` a classification loss is computed (Cross-Entropy)* ([Fine-tune BERT and Camembert for regression problem - Beginners - Hugging Face Forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/fine-tune-bert-and-camembert-for-regression-problem/332#:~:text=config.num_labels%20,Entropy)).

This means we don't have to manually change the loss function if we use the built-in Trainer (as long as we supply labels as floats). However, we'll still verify this when setting up training.

**Note on Model Choice:** We use BERT-base here, but you could consider other models:
- **RoBERTa** (a BERT variant) or **DistilBERT** (lighter version of BERT) could also be used similarly.
- If your prompts are in a specific domain (e.g., code, or a language other than English), a different pretrained model might perform better.
- BERT-base has 110M parameters, which is fairly heavy. If you need faster training, consider `distilbert-base-uncased` (66M parameters) at the cost of some accuracy. Conversely, if you have lots of data and compute, a larger model like `bert-large-uncased` might perform better.

### 2.2 Modifying BERT to Output a Single Continuous Score <a name="bert-regression-head"></a>

With `num_labels=1`, our `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` is essentially a BERT with a regression head. Under the hood:
- The model still produces the hidden `[CLS]` token representation (of size 768 for bert-base).
- This is fed into a linear layer of shape (768 -> 1) to produce a single logit as output.
- During training, this output will be compared to the true score with a regression loss (MSE).

If we wanted to build this manually (for understanding), it would look like:

```python
from transformers import BertModel
import torch.nn as nn

# Load base BERT (without classification head)
base_model = BertModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
# Create a regression head
regression_head = nn.Linear(base_model.config.hidden_size, 1)  # 768 -> 1
```

We would then forward the `[CLS]` token through `regression_head`. But since `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` with `num_labels=1` does this for us, we don't need to manually define it.

One thing to consider: the raw output of this model is a single number (logit) which can be any real value. Since our quality scores are bounded [0,1], you **could** apply a sigmoid to the output to constrain it between 0 and 1. However, if we train with MSE on targets 0-1, the model will learn to output values in that range even without an explicit sigmoid (the linear layer can learn to produce values in [0,1] for the training distribution). Sometimes, if strict bounding is needed, one might include a sigmoid layer and train with a suitable loss (like binary cross-entropy for a "probability"), but here treating it as regression with MSE should suffice. We will interpret the model's raw output as the quality score. If the model outputs a value outside [0,1] for a new prompt, we can clamp it or treat values <0 as 0 and >1 as 1 for safety.

With the model and tokenizer ready, let's move to preparing the data for fine-tuning.

## 3. Fine-Tuning the Model <a name="fine-tuning"></a>

Fine-tuning involves feeding our prompt texts through the tokenizer and then training the BERT model on these inputs with the pseudo-labels. We'll use Hugging Face's `Trainer` API to simplify training.

### 3.1 Tokenization and Dataset Creation <a name="tokenization"></a>

To feed the data into BERT, each prompt must be tokenized: converted into input IDs and attention masks (and token type ids, though for single-sentence inputs, token type ids are all zeros by default for BERT).

We'll use the Hugging Face **Datasets** library to create a dataset that the Trainer can use. This library can handle large datasets efficiently (including memory-mapping if needed) and integrates well with the Trainer.

First, let's create a `Dataset` object from our Python lists:

```python
from datasets import Dataset, DatasetDict

# Assume `prompts` is a list of prompt strings and `pseudo_labels` is the list of float scores.
data = Dataset.from_dict({
    'text': prompts,
    'label': pseudo_labels  # naming the column 'label' for compatibility with Trainer
})
# It's good to shuffle and maybe split into train/validation
data = data.shuffle(seed=42)
split_data = data.train_test_split(test_size=0.1)  # 90% train, 10% val for example
train_dataset = split_data['train']
val_dataset = split_data['test']

print(train_dataset[0])  # print one example to verify structure
```

This yields a dictionary like `{'text': "some prompt text", 'label': 0.57}` for a random training example. We reserved 10% for validation to monitor performance on unseen data during training.

Now we tokenize the text. We will use the tokenizer's `__call__` (which is invoked by `tokenizer(...)`) to encode the prompts. We should enable truncation to handle long prompts and optionally padding. The Trainer can dynamically pad batches if we use a `DataCollatorWithPadding`, so we don't need to pad everything to max length now (which would waste space). We'll just truncate, and pad later per batch.

```python
def tokenize_function(example):
    return tokenizer(
        example["text"], 
        padding="none",  # we'll handle padding later to max length of each batch
        truncation=True,
        max_length=128    # you can choose 128, 256, 512 based on average lengths and memory 
    )

# Use map to tokenize the datasets
train_dataset = train_dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
val_dataset   = val_dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Set the format for PyTorch
train_dataset.set_format(type="torch", columns=["input_ids", "attention_mask", "label"])
val_dataset.set_format(type="torch", columns=["input_ids", "attention_mask", "label"])
```

We limited `max_length=128` in this example to keep inputs smaller (which helps speed up training). If many prompts are longer than that, you might increase it, but remember BERT-base's max is 512 tokens. You can also leave out `max_length` and just use `truncation=True` which defaults to the model's position embedding max (512). 

The dataset now has tokenized inputs and labels ready for training. We've also set the format to PyTorch tensors so that the Trainer will get PyTorch tensors directly.

### 3.2 Using Hugging Face's Trainer API <a name="trainer-setup"></a>

Hugging Face `Trainer` greatly simplifies the training loop boilerplate. It requires:
- `model`: the model to train (we have that).
- `args`: a `TrainingArguments` object to specify hyperparameters and settings.
- `train_dataset` and `eval_dataset`.
- `compute_metrics` (optional): a function to compute evaluation metrics from predictions.

Let's set up the `TrainingArguments` and a `compute_metrics` for our regression task. 

We will use Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error as primary metrics, and also compute Pearson and Spearman correlation to see how well the rankings match:

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import pearsonr, spearmanr

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="output/prompt_quality_model",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",     # evaluate at end of each epoch
    save_strategy="epoch",           # save checkpoint at end of each epoch
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model="eval_mse",
    logging_steps=50,                # log training loss every 50 steps
)

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    """Compute regression metrics: MSE, MAE, Pearson, Spearman."""
    predictions, labels = eval_pred
    # The model returns a shape (n,1) for predictions; flatten it:
    preds = predictions.flatten()
    labels = labels.flatten()
    mse = ((preds - labels) ** 2).mean().item()
    mae = np.abs(preds - labels).mean().item()
    pearson_corr = pearsonr(preds, labels)[0]
    spearman_corr = spearmanr(preds, labels)[0]
    return {
        "mse": mse,
        "mae": mae,
        "pearson": pearson_corr,
        "spearman": spearman_corr
    }
```

A few points on the setup:
- We chose a **learning rate** of 2e-5, which is a common starting point for BERT fine-tuning.
- **Batch size** of 16 per device. If you have a GPU with more memory, you could try 32. Note that with 450k examples, larger batch sizes speed up epoch time but watch out for memory limits.
- **Epochs**: 3 is a usual default for BERT fine-tuning. Given the dataset is large, one epoch already covers a lot of data. You might even consider 1-2 epochs or using early stopping if the model converges. On the other hand, because labels are noisy (pseudo-labels), more epochs might help it fit the data better. We will start with 3 and see.
- **Weight decay**: 0.01 to regularize and prevent overfitting.
- **evaluation_strategy="epoch"** means it will run evaluation on the `eval_dataset` at the end of each epoch. This along with `load_best_model_at_end=True` and `metric_for_best_model="eval_mse"` ensures that after training, we have the model that achieved the lowest MSE on the validation set.
- We log training progress every 50 steps just to have intermediate feedback.

The `compute_metrics` uses NumPy and SciPy to calculate:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Pearson correlation coefficient
  - Spearman rank correlation

These metrics give a comprehensive view:
  - **MSE** punishes large errors more (by squaring them).
  - **MAE** is more interpretable as the average absolute difference in score.
  - **Pearson** measures linear correlation between predicted and true scores (value from -1 to 1, where 1 means perfect linear correlation).
  - **Spearman** measures rank correlation (i.e., how well the model's ranking of prompts by quality matches the true ranking), which is useful if we care about ordering more than exact values.

Pearson and Spearman are often used to evaluate quality scoring models or systems where the absolute value isn't as important as the relative ordering or correlation ([    Kaggle Evaluation Metrics Used for Regression Problems
](https://safjan.com/kaggle-evaluation-metrics-used-for-regression-problems/#:~:text=,RMSLE)).

Now we instantiate the Trainer:

```python
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=val_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics
)
```

### 3.3 Loss Function and Hyperparameters <a name="loss-and-hyperparams"></a>

Before we actually train, a quick note on the loss function: As mentioned, because `num_labels=1`, the model will use MSELoss internally ([Which loss function in bertforsequenceclassification regression - Beginners - Hugging Face Forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/which-loss-function-in-bertforsequenceclassification-regression/1432#:~:text=if%20self,1)). We don't need to override it. But if we wanted to experiment with other loss functions (like MAE loss or Huber loss), we could subclass `Trainer` and override the `compute_loss` method, or use a custom training loop. For most cases, MSE is appropriate for regression.

Our hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs) can be tuned. With 450k examples, one epoch is a lot of steps. If using a single GPU and batch_size=16, steps per epoch = 450000/16 ≈ 28125 steps. Three epochs ~ 84k steps. That is quite large, so training will take a while. You might consider:
- Using multiple GPUs (increase `per_device_train_batch_size` effectively or use `Trainer` with distributed training).
- Lowering epochs if you see it converges earlier.
- Using gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch if needed (Trainer has `gradient_accumulation_steps` argument).

The training arguments as set should work for a first run. Monitor memory usage and adjust batch size if necessary.

### 3.4 Training the Model <a name="training-run"></a>

We can now kick off the training. This might take significant time for 450k prompts, so be prepared. The Trainer will display progress and metrics:

```python
trainer.train()
```

During training, you'll see output every 50 steps (as we set `logging_steps=50`) with the training loss, and at the end of each epoch you'll see evaluation metrics. For example, you might see lines like:

```
Step ... - loss: 0.0234 - learning_rate: ... 
...
Epoch 1: {'eval_mse': 0.0123, 'eval_mae': 0.089, 'eval_pearson': 0.45, 'eval_spearman': 0.43, 'epoch': 1}
```

These tell you how well the model is fitting. Since the labels are pseudo and possibly noisy, don't be surprised if MSE doesn't reach extremely low values; focus on trends. If eval MSE starts increasing, it may indicate overfitting.

We set `load_best_model_at_end=True`, so after `.train()`, the model in `trainer.model` will be the one from the best epoch (by validation MSE). If you want to implement early stopping, you could use a `transformers.EarlyStoppingCallback`. For instance:

```python
from transformers import EarlyStoppingCallback
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=val_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    callbacks=[EarlyStoppingCallback(early_stopping_patience=1)]
)
```

Setting `early_stopping_patience=1` would stop training if the eval metric (MSE in our case) doesn't improve for 1 consecutive evaluation (epoch). Given the large data, it might be fine to train full epochs and rely on best model selection.

After training completes, we should evaluate the model on the validation set (though we already have metrics from during training) and possibly on a separate test set if available.

## 4. Evaluation <a name="evaluation"></a>

Now we assess how well our model is scoring prompts. This involves quantitative metrics and qualitative inspection of some predictions.

### 4.1 Recommended Evaluation Metrics <a name="metrics"></a>

For a regression model like this, key metrics include:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average squared difference between predicted scores and actual scores. Lower is better; 0 means perfect predictions.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures average absolute difference. This is more interpretable (e.g., if MAE = 0.1, on average the prediction is off by 0.1 on a 0-1 scale).
- **Correlation Coefficients**: We use Pearson and Spearman:
  - *Pearson's r*: Indicates linear correlation ([Comparison of Pearson vs Spearman Correlation Coefficients](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/03/comparison-of-pearson-and-spearman-correlation-coefficients/#:~:text=Coefficients%20www,use%20Pearson%20for%20continuous)). For example, if high-quality prompts (label near 1) consistently get higher predicted scores than low-quality prompts (label near 0), Pearson will be high. But Pearson is sensitive to linearity and outliers.
  - *Spearman's ρ*: Indicates rank-order correlation ([Pearson and Spearman Correlations: A Guide to Understanding and ...](https://datascientest.com/en/pearson-and-spearman-correlations-a-guide-to-understanding-and-applying-correlation-methods#:~:text=Pearson%20and%20Spearman%20Correlations%3A%20A,rank%20of%20the%20data)). This is useful if we care about the relative ranking of prompts by quality. It ignores whether the relationship is linear and just looks at monotonic agreement.
- **R² (coefficient of determination)**: Sometimes used to indicate the percentage of variance in the true scores explained by the predictions. This can be derived from Pearson's r in simple cases or computed directly. (We did not include it above, but it's another metric you could compute: R² = 1 - (MSE/variance_of_labels).)

Given our `compute_metrics`, we already get MSE, MAE, Pearson, Spearman on the validation set. If you have a **small human-labeled test set** of prompt qualities (perhaps you set aside 100 prompts and manually gave them quality scores as a sanity check), you should evaluate on that as well to see how the model performs on real labels (since validation is also pseudo-labeled in this scenario).

### 4.2 Evaluating Model Performance <a name="evaluate-performance"></a>

We can use the trainer to get metrics on the validation set (which we did each epoch). To get the final result on val (with the best model loaded):

```python
eval_results = trainer.evaluate()
print(eval_results)
```

This should output a dictionary with metrics, e.g.:
```python
{'eval_loss': 0.0105, 'eval_mse': 0.0105, 'eval_mae': 0.0812,
 'eval_pearson': 0.52, 'eval_spearman': 0.50, 'epoch': 3.0}
```
*(The numbers are illustrative.)*

Here, `eval_loss` is actually MSE (for regression, the loss used is MSE which coincides with our eval_mse). We see Pearson ~0.52, Spearman ~0.50, which indicates a moderate positive correlation between predicted and true quality rankings. If this was a real scenario, we would hope for even higher correlations if the quality metric is consistent.

If you have a true test set, use `trainer.predict(test_dataset)` to get predictions and then compute metrics similarly. For example:

```python
# If test_dataset is a Dataset object of labeled prompts:
predictions = trainer.predict(test_dataset)
preds = predictions.predictions.flatten()
labels = predictions.label_ids.flatten()
# Compute metrics manually or reuse compute_metrics
metrics = compute_metrics((preds, labels))
print(metrics)
```

Now, let's do some **qualitative checks**. It's helpful to see a few prompt examples with their predicted quality score (and true score if available) to gauge if it matches intuition:

```python
# Get some predictions on validation set
val_preds = trainer.predict(val_dataset)
pred_scores = val_preds.predictions.flatten()
true_scores = val_preds.label_ids.flatten()

# Let's inspect 5 random examples from the validation set
import random
for i in random.sample(range(len(val_dataset)), 5):
    text = val_dataset[i]['text']
    pred = float(pred_scores[i])
    true = float(true_scores[i])
    print(f"Prompt: {text}\nPredicted Quality: {pred:.3f}, True Quality: {true:.3f}\n")
```

This will print out some prompts along with model's predicted quality and the pseudo-label. Since the true label is pseudo in this case, don't over-interpret the "True Quality" – but we want the predictions to at least roughly line up.

For example, you might see:
```
Prompt: "Write a detailed essay on the impacts of climate change on coastal cities."
Predicted Quality: 0.812, True Quality: 0.900

Prompt: "hello?"
Predicted Quality: 0.102, True Quality: 0.050
...
```
These would indicate the model is giving higher score to a detailed prompt than a trivial one, which is good.

### 4.3 Visualizing Performance and Predictions <a name="visualization"></a>

Visualization can provide insight into the model's behavior:
- **Scatter plot** of true vs predicted scores: We expect points roughly along a diagonal if the model is good. Any systematic deviation or large dispersion can be seen here.
- **Distribution** of scores: Compare distribution of predicted scores to true scores (are they both roughly uniform, or normal, etc.?).
- **Error analysis**: Plot the error (predicted - true) distribution.

Let's do a quick scatter plot of the validation set predictions:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(5,5))
plt.scatter(true_scores, pred_scores, alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel("True Quality Score")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Quality Score")
plt.title("Predicted vs True Quality Scores (Validation)")
# Plot a diagonal line for reference
min_val, max_val = 0, 1
plt.plot([min_val, max_val], [min_val, max_val], color='red')
plt.xlim(min_val, max_val)
plt.ylim(min_val, max_val)
plt.show()
```

This will show how well the points align on the diagonal (red line). If the model were perfect, all points would lie on that line. In reality, they'll be scattered around it. The tighter the cloud around the line, the better. 

You can also visualize the error distribution:

```python
errors = pred_scores - true_scores
plt.figure()
plt.hist(errors, bins=50, color='orange')
plt.xlabel("Prediction Error (Pred - True)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Distribution of Prediction Errors")
plt.show()
```

This should ideally center around 0. A slight bias (mean error not 0) might indicate the model tends to over- or under-predict quality.

Given that our "true" labels are pseudo, the evaluation is mainly checking consistency with those pseudo labels. If you have any real labeled data, it's important to check performance there as well to ensure the model actually generalizes to what *you* consider quality.

## 5. Inference <a name="inference"></a>

Once the model is trained, we can use it to score new prompts. In a notebook or live setting, we typically:
1. Load the trained model (if not already in memory).
2. Tokenize new input prompt(s).
3. Run the model to get the output score.
4. Possibly apply a sigmoid or clamp if we want to strictly bound it [0,1], but usually just take the raw output.

Since we used `Trainer`, our model is already fine-tuned and (with `load_best_model_at_end=True`) should be the best version. We can directly use `trainer.model` or the `model` variable if it points to the trained model.

### 5.1 Scoring New Prompts after Training <a name="scoring-new"></a>

Let's say you have a list of new prompt strings:

```python
new_prompts = [
    "Write a short poem about sunsets.",
    "sports?",
    "Provide a detailed analysis of the French Revolution causes and effects."
]
```

We want to get quality scores for these:

```python
# Ensure model is in evaluation mode
model.eval()

# Tokenize new prompts
inputs = tokenizer(new_prompts, padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=128, return_tensors="pt")

# Run the model to get outputs
import torch
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
# outputs.logits will contain shape (batch_size, 1)
scores = outputs.logits.squeeze().tolist()  # squeeze to shape (batch_size,)

for prompt, score in zip(new_prompts, scores):
    # Optionally, clamp the score to [0,1] if desired:
    score_clamped = max(0.0, min(1.0, score))
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt}\nPredicted Quality Score: {score_clamped:.3f}\n")
```

This will output something like:
```
Prompt: Write a short poem about sunsets.
Predicted Quality Score: 0.732

Prompt: sports?
Predicted Quality Score: 0.104

Prompt: Provide a detailed analysis of the French Revolution causes and effects.
Predicted Quality Score: 0.889
```

We see the model rates the detailed analysis prompt higher than the one-word "sports?" prompt, which makes sense. These scores are hypothetical since our pseudo-labeling was simple; with a better labeling method, the model's judgments would align with more nuanced quality definitions.

**Important**: If your model's outputs aren't naturally bounded (they might be slightly below 0 or above 1), you can take `score = torch.sigmoid(outputs.logits).item()` to squash into [0,1]. But that sigmoid was not used during training; doing it now is somewhat arbitrary. It might make sense if you had trained with a different loss. Typically, with MSE and targets 0-1, the model learns to predict in-range. You can always post-process by clamping 0-1 as done above to avoid any out-of-range predictions being interpreted incorrectly.

### 5.2 Batch Inference Example <a name="batch-inference"></a>

The above code already shows batch processing (we passed a list of prompts to the tokenizer). The `tokenizer` can take a list and return tensors of shape `[batch_size, seq_len]`. The model outputs a batch of scores in one go. This is efficient for scoring many prompts. If you have a large number of new prompts to score, you may want to use a DataLoader or chunk them to avoid memory issues, but the process is the same:
- Prepare a batch
- Run the model
- Collect scores

For instance, using the `Trainer` for prediction on a large unlabeled set is also possible:
```python
unlabeled_dataset = Dataset.from_dict({"text": new_prompts})
unlabeled_dataset = unlabeled_dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
unlabeled_dataset.set_format(type="torch", columns=["input_ids", "attention_mask"])
predictions = trainer.predict(unlabeled_dataset)
preds = predictions.predictions.flatten()
```
This yields the same results. But for simple use, direct model invocation as shown is fine.

Now that we know how to use the model for inference, let's discuss how to save and deploy it.

## 6. Deployment (Optional) <a name="deployment"></a>

Deployment involves saving the trained model and making it available for use in an application or service. We will cover saving the model and two simple deployment approaches: using the Hugging Face pipeline for quick scoring and setting up a FastAPI service for a more production-ready API.

### 6.1 Saving and Exporting the Model <a name="saving-model"></a>

After training, you should save your model and tokenizer to disk for later use (or to share with others):

```python
output_dir = "prompt-quality-bert-regressor"
tokenizer.save_pretrained(output_dir)
model.save_pretrained(output_dir)
```

This saves the model weights, config, and tokenizer files into the `prompt-quality-bert-regressor` directory. You can later load the model from this directory without retraining.

If you plan to use the model in a different environment or want to deploy it, ensure you have these files accessible. You can also compress them or upload to the Hugging Face Hub (with `model.push_to_hub("your-username/your-model-name")` if you have a Hugging Face account, but given this is local/offline, we'll stick to local saving).

For optimized serving, you might consider converting the model to ONNX or TorchScript, but that's an advanced step not necessary for a basic deployment. We'll proceed with the PyTorch model.

### 6.2 Loading the Model for Inference <a name="loading-model"></a>

In any environment (say a separate script or a web service), you can load the model by:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model_path = "prompt-quality-bert-regressor"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)
```

This restores the tokenizer and model. Because the config (saved with the model) has `num_labels=1`, it knows it's a regression model. You can then call `model` on new inputs as we did before.

### 6.3 Serving the Model (Pipeline or FastAPI) <a name="serving-model"></a>

For quick testing or usage, Hugging Face provides a **pipeline** API. While there isn't a specific "regression" pipeline, you can use the `text-classification` pipeline for our model. It will treat the single output as a class probability. Typically, with `num_labels=1`, `pipeline("text-classification")` will output a dictionary with `'label': '__label__0'` and `'score': <value>` where `<value>` is the *sigmoid of the output logit*. That might not directly give the regression score we want (it might give a number between 0.5 and 1 because of the way it's handled internally). 

Instead, we might just write a small wrapper or use the model directly. Nonetheless, for completeness, here's how you could use the pipeline:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
regression_pipeline = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, return_all_scores=False)
result = regression_pipeline("This is an example prompt to score")[0]
print(result)
```

This might output something like `{'label': 'LABEL_0', 'score': 0.723}`. Here, `score` is essentially the model output normalized via a sigmoid to [0,1]. You can take that as the quality score. If the pipeline's behavior is not as expected, it's straightforward to just use the model as we did in section 5.

For a more robust deployment (e.g., a web service), you can use **FastAPI** to create an API endpoint that returns the score for a given prompt. Here's a simple example:

```python
!pip install fastapi uvicorn -q

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

# Load model and tokenizer (assuming done as above)
# tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
# model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)
model.eval()

class PromptRequest(BaseModel):
    prompt: str

@app.post("/score_prompt")
def score_prompt(request: PromptRequest):
    prompt_text = request.prompt
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=128)
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model(**inputs)
        score = output.logits.item()
    # Clamp the score between 0 and 1
    score = max(0.0, min(1.0, score))
    return {"prompt": prompt_text, "predicted_quality": score}
```

You would run this API with Uvicorn (uncomment and run in a script or appropriate environment):
```bash
uvicorn your_script_name:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
Then, you could send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/score_prompt` with a JSON body like `{"prompt": "your prompt here"}` and get back a JSON with the predicted quality.

This FastAPI app loads the model once at startup and then for each request, tokenizes the input prompt, gets the score, and returns it. This is a simple example and not optimized for high throughput (for instance, you might add batch processing or async workers for more load).

**Testing the API (if it were running):** You could do:
```python
import requests
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/score_prompt", json={"prompt": "Hello world"})
print(response.json())
```
which should return `{"prompt": "Hello world", "predicted_quality": 0.123}` (some score).

**Note:** For actual production use, consider factors like authentication, model quantization for speed, and deploying behind a web server. But those are beyond our scope here.

## Conclusion

We have walked through:
- Preparing a large set of unlabeled text prompts and applying **weak supervision** to generate pseudo labels ([Essential Guide to Weak Supervision | Snorkel AI](https://snorkel.ai/data-centric-ai/weak-supervision/#:~:text=Weak%20supervision%20is%20an%20approach,examples%20manually%2C%20one%20by%20one)).
- Setting up a BERT-based model for regression output and fine-tuning it using Hugging Face's Trainer (with MSE loss by default for a single output ([Fine-tune BERT and Camembert for regression problem - Beginners - Hugging Face Forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/fine-tune-bert-and-camembert-for-regression-problem/332#:~:text=config.num_labels%20,Entropy))).
- Evaluating the model with appropriate regression metrics and visualizations to ensure it learns the desired behavior.
- Performing inference on new prompts to get quality scores.
- Optionally, saving the model and deploying it using convenient tools.

This guide provides a template for tackling similar problems where labeled data is scarce but can be synthesized. Keep in mind that the quality of the pseudo labels is key – if you can improve those (even by adding a small set of true labeled examples), the model will improve accordingly. 

Happy prompting and modeling! **Good luck with your BERT-based prompt quality scorer!**
